# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I usually only support code for the discord.js versions that are still actively being maintained.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Just create a PR.**
Unless you have a good reason not to. Then just reach out to me.
I'm usually willing to add people on Discord when provided with a proper reason.
Idk, if you actually find something, you probably know better than me and should rely on your judgement.
